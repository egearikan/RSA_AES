# RSA and AES
Tool for enc. and dec. files in RSA and AES

RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. In such a cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and distinct from the decryption key which is kept secret (private). 

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), is a symmetric key encryption cipher. This means that the same key used to encrypt the data is used to decrypt it.

PS. It is important that you should download and import the relevant modules.(Some of the modules were not compatible with MacOS while coding this, so instead Windows 10 was used for this project)
